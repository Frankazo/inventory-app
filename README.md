 INTRODUCTION
 ------------

  This is the First project for Software engineering Immersive SEI09.
  Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

  The project is base on building a Webapp that runs the game, create the game from scratch, follow all the requirement and deploy a working version on Github.
